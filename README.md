# Create a cx_Oracle Lambda Layer

This script will build a working cx_Oracle lambda layer bundled with the Oracle instant client for python version 3.9.10 - you can build it in Cloud9 or wherever you need.

You can adjust for other Python versions (3.6 and above). The layer won't work if built on a Mac M1 as it's not x86 architecture.
